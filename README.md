Madness Zombie Horde.

An addictive, top-down shooter game, fighting an endless zombie horde. The horde endlessly pursuits while you mow them down. Inspired by the likes of Plant vs Zombies and Madness Combat.

Use the S/A to move down and W/D to move up move. The weapon can be fired by pressing down the spacebar.

Best of luck surviving the horde...
